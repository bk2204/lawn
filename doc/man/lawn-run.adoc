= lawn-run(1)

== Name

lawn run - spawn commands on your local machine

== Synopsis

'lawn run' -- <command> [<arg>â€¦]

== Description

`lawn run` spawns the command specified on the local machine.
The name of the command must match one of the commands under the `commands` block in the configuration file.

When run, the server runs the command specified under the `if` entry for that command, which is obligatory.
If the command exits successfully, then the command specified under the `command` entry is executed with the arguments given on the command line.
If the `if` command fails, the `command` entry is not executed.

== Examples

Assume we have the following configuration file:

[source,yaml]
----
v0:
  commands:
    printf:
      if: true
      command: printf
    browser:
      if: '!command -v firefox'
      command: '!f() { firefox --new-tab "$@"; };f'
----

Running `lawn run -- printf "%s\n" "Hello, world!"` will run `printf "%s\n" "Hello, world!"`, which will print `Hello, world!` and exit.

Running `lawn run -- browser https://git-scm.com` will open that site in a new tab in Firefox on the local machine, if and only if Firefox is installed.
If Firefox is not present, the command will fail.
