= lawn-proxy(1)

== Name

lawn proxy - run a command with a Lawn-enabled SSH agent

== Synopsis

'lawn proxy' -- <command> [<arg>â€¦]

== Description

`lawn proxy` runs the given command with a substituted SSH agent socket in the environment variable `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`.
This SSH agent understands Lawn extensions and, if forwarded to a remote machine with `ssh -A`, can be used to run lawn commands instead of needing to forward the actual Lawn socket to the remote machine.
This is simpler and easier than performing Unix socket forwarding with OpenSSH, but is somewhat less efficient and more bandwidth intensive.

Regular agent commands (that is, those commands that are not Lawn extensions) are passed to the agent in effect at the time `lawn proxy` was invoked.
Consequently, normal commands like `ssh-add -l` and regular agent signing should work as normal.

== Examples

In the following session, `lawn proxy` is used to proxy the SSH socket to a remote machine and run a command on the local machine:

[source,console]
----
user@local:~$ lawn proxy -- ssh -A user@remote
user@remote:~$ lawn run -- printf 'Hello, world!\n'
Hello, world!
----
