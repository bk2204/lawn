== Name

lawn mount - provide access to a 9P file share

== Synopsis

'lawn mount' (--fd | --socket) <share>  -- <command> [<arg>â€¦]

== Description

`lawn mount` provides access to a 9P or SFTP file share specified by `<share>`, which is listed in the configuration file, to the specified command.
This access can either via standard input and standard output or via a Unix socket.

The protocol used may be the original 9P2000, the Unix variant 9P2000.u, the Linux variant 9P2000.L, or SFTP version 3.

If 9P is used, the variant is negotiated over the protocol itself.
The Linux variant is recommended.
No authentication is required except the socket or pipes and any username and resource name (`uname` and `aname` fields) are accepted.

For SFTP, version 3 is provided and the hardlink, POSIX rename, and fsync OpenSSH extensions are supported.
These extensions and protocol version are supported by OpenSSH and sshfs.

== Options

`--type=<protocol>`::
  Use the specified protocol, which should be either `9p` for any variant of 9P, or `sftp` for any supported SFTP version.
  The default, if not specified, is `9p`.

`--fd`::
  Provide access to the 9P protocol via the standard input and output of the specified command.
  The file descriptors are destroyed when the command exits.

`--socket`::
  Create a Unix socket to provide access and expose it to the command via the environment variable `P9P_SOCKET` (for 9P) or `LAWN_SFTP_SOCKET` (for SFTP).
  The socket is destroyed when the command exits.

== Examples

Assume we have the following configuration file:

[source,yaml]
----
v0:
  fs:
    temp:
      if: true
      location: /tmp
    home:
      if: true
      command: '!printf "%s" "$HOME"'
----

Running `lawn mount --socket temp -- sh -c '9pfuse "unix!$P9P_SOCKET" ~/mnt/foo; sleep 2d'` will mount the `temp` file share, which is located on the root machine at `/tmp`, to this machine at `~/mnt/foo` using 9P.

Running `lawn mount --fd home -- sudo mount -t 9p -o trans=fd,rdfno=0,wfdno=1 home ~/mnt/home` on Linux will mount the `home` file share, which is located on the root machine at `$HOME`, to this machine at `~/mnt/home` using 9P.

Running `lawn mount --fd --type=sftp home -- sshfs -o passive :/ ~/mnt/home` on Linux will mount the `home` file share, which is located on the root machine at `$HOME`, to this machine at `~/mnt/home` using SFTP.
