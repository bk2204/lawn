Lawn (local spawn) is a program to allow spawning programs on your local computer from a trusted remote system, like a remote development environment.
This has several applications:

* Spawning a graphical editor on your local machine to edit files remotely without the hassle and overhead of X11 forwarding
* Copying to and pasting from your local machine's clipboard via the remote system
* Accessing credentials through a credential helper

In addition, Lawn provides functionality for mounting a portion of your local file system on the remote machine.  This can be useful for preserving your shell history, work in progress, or whatever else you'd like.
