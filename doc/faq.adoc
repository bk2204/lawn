== Raison D'ÃŠtre

Why can't I just use X11 forwarding to run a GUI on my machine?::
  You definitely can.
  However, if you're using an editor, such as Neovim, that operates by using a client-server architecture with stdio, then you can send a lot less data over the connection if you're using the client-server architecture rather than running a GUI.
  This can be important if your remote system is not necessarily close to you on the Internet.
+
In addition, if you're using a Mac, then X11 forwarding requires an X server, which you might not want to install, and it will always require some software on the remote system (such as `xauth`), which you might not want to install on the server.

Why can't I just use OSC 52 to do copy and paste?::
  Again, you can.
  However, that effectively lets every machine you work on operate on your clipboard, and maybe that's not what you want.
  With Lawn, if you don't forward the socket, then there's no way for the remote side to operate on your clipboard.

== Using Lawn

Can I mix and match versions?::
  Yes!
  The protocol is explicitly designed to support a version, plus capabilities and extensions.
  If you need to use an older version on one side, then everything should degrade gracefully.
  Note that we only consider compatibility of released versions.
  It's possible that a version from the main branch might be broken.

Do I need separate binaries for the local and remote machines?::
  Nope.
  One binary provides all of the functionality, both client and server.

== Terminology

What are the local, remote, and root machines?::
  The local machine, also known as the root machine, is the machine on which the main Lawn server and the commands spawned run.
  This is typically a user's laptop or desktop.
+
A remote machine is any other machine which connects back to the local machine.
Typically one accesses the remote machine by connecting to it with SSH.

What is 9P and what variants does Lawn support?::
  9P is the Plan 9 file system protocol.
  It is a generic way to access files over a socket or pipe.
  9P is used for sharing files between a host and guest when using QEMU's virtio-9p functionality, and it can be easily implemented with FUSE.
+
There are three protocol versions supported: https://ericvh.github.io/9p-rfc/rfc9p2000.html[the original 9P2000], https://ericvh.github.io/9p-rfc/rfc9p2000.u.html[the Unix variant 9P2000.u], and https://github.com/chaos/diod/blob/master/protocol.md[the Linux variant 9P2000.L].
Lawn supports all of these, but the Linux variant is the best tested and most recommended, regardless of the operating system in use.
That's because in general, it's the most featureful and easiest to correctly implement on a Unix system.

== Compatibility

Can I use a Neovim GUI with Lawn?::
  Yes, this is possible.
  The link:example-use-cases.adoc[example use case documentation] covers how to do that with neovim-gtk.
  This is likely possible with other variants as well.

Can I use Emacs with Lawn?::
  It doesn't appear so.
  Emacs has a client-server architecture but it appears that the client sends the names of files to be edited to the server, which then opens them.
  This is a problem because the server is the GUI component and must run on the local machine, so when the client sends a request to open files, the server won't have access to them.
+
If you have different information that shows that this can be done, please let us know.


== Internals and Future Plans

What does the protocol look like?::
  The protocol is outlined in the comments of `lawn-protocol/src/protocol/mod.rs`.
  Each request has three little-endian 32-bit words (size, ID, and message type), plus an optional CBOR blob.
  Each response has three little-endian 32-bit words (size, ID, and response code), also with an optional CBOR blob.
  We plan to document this in the documentation.
+
Note also that in many places, the protocol can be extended.
For example, we permit custom authentication mechanisms and channel types provided those are in the form `extension@hostname.com`, just like in the SSH protocol.

What features are planned?::
  There are a bunch of planned features which aren't yet implemented.
  Included in that are TTY support for command and credential storage using the system credential store.
  We also plan to implement a small Lisp-like language that can be used instead of shell in the configuration file.

Why does Lawn use Linux error codes internally?::
  Lawn implements the 9P2000.L variant of the 9P protocol, which uses Linux errno values.
  Because Lawn runs across operating systems and environments, it makes sense to use a standard set of errno values so that functionality works across systems, and since we already have to use the Linux error codes, it makes sense to use them everywhere.
